# Unwrapping Swift Optionals

This is a `*.playground` file for a live demo of my future blog post. You can clone this repo and run the `*.playground` file to read it! ğŸ˜„

P.S: This is written on Xcode 8 and Swift 3. If you want to try the Swift 2.2 version, kindly checkout to `swift-2.2` tag :)

P.P.S: If the `*.playground` file shown as a full-of-comment text, kindly go to `Editor > Show Rendered Markup` to view it in a sort-of-blog-post mode ğŸ˜‰
